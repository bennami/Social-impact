I tried to create a website in a day with bootstrap and css.

I struggled a lot, but at least i made all the clickable links help you navigate.

struggled with cover image, I refused to copy paste the code because i didn't understad it. Tried to make it from scratch, bootstrap kept over writing a bunch of stuff.
